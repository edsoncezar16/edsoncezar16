# About 

I'm a Data Engineer with a Ph.D. in Physics from the Federal University of Par√°. I combine my analytical rigor and technical knowledge to create and maintain efficient data engineering solutions.

My expertise lies in ELT processes, Cloud Computing with AWS, Data Integration, and Processing using tools like SQL, Python, Meltano, and Airflow. My hands-on experience in AWS DMS, Kubernetes, and Terraform has allowed me to lead and contribute to significant projects, ensuring that data is processed, integrated, and available in the most optimized manner.

Having started my career as a Data Engineering Intern at Indicium, I quickly climbed the ranks due to my relentless pursuit of innovation and R&D initiatives. I've had the pleasure of contributing to the Meltano base project and have always been passionate about implementing state-of-the-art technologies and techniques.

I'm always open to connecting with professionals who share a passion for data and technology. Feel free to reach out.
