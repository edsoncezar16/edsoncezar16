# About 

I'm Edson Cezar Moraes Nogueira, a forward-thinking Data Engineer based in Belém, Pará, Brazil. With a Ph.D. in Physics from the Federal University of Pará and relevant industry experience, I blend analytical rigor with advanced technical skills in the realm of data engineering.

My experience spans a range of technologies and platforms, including Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure, GCP, Databricks), ELT (Meltano, dbt, Airflow, PySpark), and DevOps (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform). I excel in environments that require both strong analytical skills and the ability to communicate and collaborate effectively within teams.

I'm always open to connecting and discussing innovative solutions in data engineering, feel free to be in touch!
