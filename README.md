# About 

I am a highly motivated Data Engineer from Belém, Pará, Brazil, with a strong academic background in Physics (Ph.D.) from the Federal University of Pará. I'm currently expanding my knowledge in the field of Data Science through a B.Sc. program at XP Education.

I bring a unique perspective to data engineering, combining strong problem-solving and analytical skills with excellent communication and teamwork abilities. Currently, I am working as a Data Engineering Intern at Indicium, where I develop and maintain efficient ELT processes using SQL, Python, Airflow, Meltano, Docker, and Cloud Computing. My experience includes creating and maintaining data pipelines for critical applications and utilizing APIs for data ingestion in ELT processes.

One of my key projects is tap-totango (https://pypi.org/project/tap-totango), a Singer tap for the Totango API, built using the Meltano Singer SDK with Python. My dedication to continuous learning and improvement drives me to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and technologies, making me a valuable asset to any data-driven team.
