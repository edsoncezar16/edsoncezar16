# About 

Hello! I'm Edson Cezar Moraes Nogueira, a highly motivated Data Engineer based in Belém - Pará - Brazil. I recently completed my Ph.D. in Physics from the Federal University of Pará, which has complemented my technical skills with a solid analytical mindset.

In my current role at Indicium as a Junior Data Engineer, I leverage my expertise in Data Warehousing, ELT, and Big Data Technologies, including Spark, to develop and maintain efficient ELT processes. In addition, I am proficient in Cloud Computing, using platforms such as Azure, AWS, and Google.

I work with a variety of tools for data integration and processing, including SQL, Python, Airflow, Meltano, and Docker. One of my notable contributions at Indicium includes adding value to the Meltano base project by implementing benchmark tests and developing custom extractors, all with the aim of modernizing our tech stack.

Before this, I had the opportunity to intern at the same company, where I began my journey of exploring ELT processes and contributing to the Meltano project through writing documentation.

Furthermore, my skills extend to open-source projects, as exemplified by my work on "tap-totango", a Singer tap for the Totango API, built using the Meltano Singer SDK and Python.

With strong problem-solving capabilities, excellent communication skills, and the ability to work effectively within a team, I am passionate about exploring new technologies and finding innovative solutions to complex data challenges.
